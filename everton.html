    <p class="text1">Everton Football Club is an English football club founded in Liverpool in 1878. The team is currently in the Premier League and has spent more seasons in the top flight than any other English club in its history. They are considered to be one of the five most successful English teams, having won the league nine times, the FA Cup five times and the CEC once. The last time they won a trophy was in 1995, the FA Cup.

      Everton were founded in 1878, and their biggest rivals are, of course, Liverpool, the city's other professional team. Their clashes are known as the Merseyside derby. In 2006, the management announced plans to build a new, larger stadium. The Stolverkos have a large fan base, with an average of 90% of maximum capacity being used in the 2005/06 season.
      
      Many well-known players have turned up at Everton. The most famous of all is Dixie Dean, who played at Goodison Park in the 1920s and 1930s and set a living goalscoring record by scoring 60 goals in a season.
